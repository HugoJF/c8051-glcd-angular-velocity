# C8051 GLCD + Measuring angular velocity

This firmware emulates a 1000 pulse/rotation disk signal, which can be configured from 18 to 902 RPMs.

Human input via terminal and output via 128x64 graphics LCD.

It basically displays the angular velocity in the screen.

I forgot to screenshot the final product, so instead, I have this glitched screen:
